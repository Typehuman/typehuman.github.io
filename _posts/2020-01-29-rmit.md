As a forward-thinking education institution, RMIT wanted to explore the role of identity, reputation and tertiary credentials for students of today’s education system.


## How did Typehuman help?

To explore this, TypeHuman conducted ethnographic research to uncover insights into the current tertiary student experience. A larger trend was identified for the tertiary sector, which is the unbundling of the university degree. This could be accelerated by blockchain, or verifiable credential technologies, which led to a test and learn scenario to better understand the value of a persistent education history record.


## The Outcomes

We were able to deploy a rapid prototyping methodology of a blockchain credential system to uncover user experience insights with students, and make recommendations that align with the University’s strategy for industry wide blockchain based digital records of education histories. As a result, RMIT engaged with an existing credential vendor to pilot a blockchain technology.
