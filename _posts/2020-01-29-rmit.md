TypeHuman worked with RMIT to explore the role of identity, reputation and tertiary credentials for students. We conducted significant ethnographic research to uncover insights into the current tertiary student experience. A larger trend was identified for the tertiary sector, which is the unbundling of university degrees. This could be accelerated by blockchain, or verifiable credential technologies, which led to a test-and-learn scenario to better understand the value of a persistent education history record.

## The Outcomes

We were able to deploy a rapid prototyping methodology of a blockchain credential system to uncover user experience insights with students, and make recommendations that align with the Universityâ€™s strategy for industry wide blockchain based digital records of education histories. As a result, RMIT engaged with an existing credential vendor to pilot a blockchain technology.
