**Give Where You Live Foundation seeking expressions of interest from technology vendors and suppliers to support the pilot of a Digital Voucher Initiative**

For several decades the Give Where You Live Foundation has facilitated a paper-based voucher initiative aimed at ensuring the most vulnerable people within the G21 region have access to goods and services during times of need.

The voucher ecosystem consists of the Give Where You Live Foundation, agency partners and approved merchants who together support people-in-need.

The Give Where You Live Foundation has received funding from the Victorian government to support the digitisation of this scheme, in support of their efforts to scale the initiative’s reach in the community, as well as improve operational efficiency.


**The Current Voucher Ecosystem**

The Give Where You Live Ecosystem is comprised of several participants: The Give Where You Live Foundation; eligible agencies who are granted and then distribute vouchers to beneficiaries; beneficiaries who are given vouchers redeemable for goods and services; and approved merchants who can receive vouchers from beneficiaries and redeem back to Give Where You Live Foundation for cash.

General steps taken to issue and redeem vouchers:

0. Ahead of funding round, review and induct agency partner(s) into the ecosystem and merchant(s) into the ecosystem
1. Budget for voucher funding round and voucher allocation to ecosystem agencies
2. Agency’s distribute vouchers to people-in-need
3. Individuals redeem vouchers for goods and services with participating merchants
4. Merchants redeem vouchers for cash from Give Where You Live Foundation
5. Give Where You Live collects data about how the vouchers have been used to evaluate need and program effectiveness
