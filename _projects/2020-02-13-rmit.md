project_results: TypeHuman was able to deploy a rapid prototyping methodology of a blockchain credential system to uncover user experience insights with students, and make recommendations that align with the universityâ€™s strategy for industry-wide, blockchain-based, digital records of education histories. As a result, RMIT engaged with an existing credential vendor to pilot a blockchain technology.

TypeHuman worked with RMIT to explore the role of identity, reputation and tertiary credentials for students. We conducted significant ethnographic research to uncover insights into the current tertiary student experience. A larger trend was identified for the tertiary sector, which is the unbundling of university degrees. This could be accelerated by blockchain, or verifiable credential technologies, which led to a test-and-learn scenario to better understand the value of a persistent education history record.
