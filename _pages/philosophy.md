It has been said that meaningful social change moves at the pace of trust. The past decade has seen a rapid wave of new technology that has fundamentally breached this trust. As a result, the promise of web 2.0 technology and the potential for positive social change was lost.

Web 3.0 technology is now emerging at an evolutionary moment for humanity, one that is framed by rising economic inequality, the unprecedented centralisation of corporate power, the fracturing of democracy and the existential perils of the climate emergency.

The words of Rebecca Solnit, written in the shadows of the second gulf war, seem appropriate for our current moment: “there are times when it seems as though not only the future but the present is dark”. These are indeed dark times.

In this context, there can be no doubt that emerging technology will play a critical role in determining what humanity is evolving to. Will technology continue fracturing our communities, destabilising our democracies and deepening the climate emergency? Or will technology re-centre our humanity, decentralise power and meaningfully reconnect humankind?

Whilst many are fearful, Rebecca Solnit reminds us that we often “transform the future's unknowability into something certain, the fulfilment of all our dread, the place beyond which there is no way forward…" Instead, history shows us the non-linear and surprising nature of social change: "anything could happen, and whether we act or not has everything to do with it.”

We believe that we need to act. Emerging technology is a tool; nothing more, nothing less. It is up to us to navigate the threats whilst seizing the exponential opportunities for increasing human prosperity in all its forms. In Rebecca Solnit’s poetic words, we believe that “the future is dark, with a darkness as much of the womb as of the grave.”
