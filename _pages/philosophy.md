It has been said that meaningful social change moves at the pace of trust. The past decade has seen a rapid wave of new technology that has fundamentally breached this trust. As a result, the promise of web 2.0 technology and the potential for positive social change was lost.

Web 3.0 technology is now emerging at an evolutionary moment for humanity, one that is framed by contrasts. Rising economic inequality, the unprecedented centralisation of corporate power, the fracturing of democracy and the existential perils of the climate emergency on the one hand, and on the other the wealth offered to humanity via technological and exponential progress in artificial intelligence, biology & health, finance, education and ongoing improvements and hardening of our information communication networks.

> Typehuman exists to help people navigate this technological change, and understand it's implications for them.

We do this by combining deep expertise in emerging technology with design and innovation methods.


There can be no doubt that emerging technology will play a critical role in determining what humanity is evolving to. Will technology continue fracturing our communities, destabilising our democracies and deepening the climate emergency? Or will technology re-centre our humanity, decentralise power and meaningfully reconnect humankind?
