We support organisations looking to incorporate emerging technology into their world. We do this by offering three core services:
 
**Strategy & Advisory:** we provide executive level advisory services to help you understand the fundamentals of technological change. In building this understanding, we define the exponential opportunities that are dawninge, while also communicating the threats inherent in a range of solutions.
 
**Design research:** We combine deep expertise in established and emerging technology with proven design and research principles. This work engages our team of service designers, experience designers, technologists and product designers, and seeks to understand problems, navigate complexities, explore connections, and distil insights and wisdom to inform a range of tailored solutions.
 
**Pilots & Solutions:** Our technology expertise allows us to develop and test ideas as pilots and proof-of-concepts. Through this piloting process we develop unique solutions in collaboration with our clients and community partners.


## Our Domain Expertise

We believe in the power of emerging technology to build a better world. Our work encompasses three primary themes where we believe the greatest opportunities exist for the application emerging technology:
 
 
### New Economics & Finance  
With the emergence of blockchain technology, the world has been inspired to reinvent finance. How we send money around the world, issue debt, build and run financial markets, and govern financial agreements are all being rebuilt with blockchain technology. This presents extraordinary opportunities to improve access, security and privacy, speed, and trust. Tailored solutions can also be built that enable the creation and execution of “smart contracts”, delivering a range of benefits to all parties involved in a transaction.

We support organisations in understanding and navigating this new world, with a focus on how new economics and finance can support those left behind. 
 
### Digital Identity & Credentials

Our lives are governed by our ability to present verifiable identity credentials. Birth certificates, passports, bank accounts, drivers licences, working with children checks. Our ability to attain and easily present these credentials and many others can significantly alter our quality of life. Australia’s recent devastating bushfires have destroyed these physical documents for many individuals, affecting their access to critical recovery funds and services. Blockchain technology provides a basis to generate, store, and share digital identities in a highly secure manner. Establishing digital identities and credentials delivers a range of benefits including improved access to essential services, in particular for society’s most vulnerable citizens and those recovering from crises.

We work with organisations to understand and tailor digital identity and credential solutions that prioritise the rights of the individual and places them in control of their data. We seek to improve access to essential services for all, and enable everyone to fully participate in society.
 
### Data, Privacy, & Analytics
 
Data extraction has become integral to models of business and governance in the 21st century. This data is often treated as “exhaust”, and of no value or meaning to the individuals from which the data was extracted. However, data is not abstract exhaust, but mined from real humans, over whom the data exert far reaching controls. At the same time, data-driven technologies can improve life in demonstrable ways and in many cases, are so entrenched as to make their use compulsory.
