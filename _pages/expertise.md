We support organisations looking to incorporate emerging technology into their world. We do this by offering three core services:

**Design research:** We combine deep expertise in established and emerging technology with proven design and research principles. This work engages our team of service designers, experience designers, technologists and product designers, and seeks to understand problems, navigate complexities, explore connections, and distil insights and wisdom to inform a range of tailored solutions.
 
**Pilots & Solutions:** Our technology expertise allows us to develop and test ideas as pilots and proof-of-concepts. Through this piloting process we develop unique solutions in collaboration with our clients and community partners.
