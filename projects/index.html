	      <p>We help you navigate technological change and its implications for people, business, society and the world around us. We do this by combining deep expertise in emerging technology, and a passion for enhancing human dignity and the world around us, with proven strategy, design and innovation methods.</p>

	      <br>

			<p>We support organisations looking to explore or adopt emerging technology, in order to play their part in creating a better a world. We do this by offering three core services:</p><br>


			<p><b>Strategy & Advisory:</b> we provide executive level advisory services to help you understand the fundamentals of technological change. In building this understanding, we define the relevant emerging opportunities, while illuminating and designing for the unintended consequences inherent in some solutions.</p><br>
			 
			<p><b>Design research:</b> We combine deep expertise in established and emerging technology with proven design and research principles. This work engages our team of service designers, experience designers, technologists and product designers, and seeks to understand problems, navigate complexities, explore connections, and distil insights and wisdom to inform a range of tailored solutions.</p><br>
			 
			<p><b>Pilots & Solutions:</b> Our technology expertise allows us to develop and test ideas as pilots and proof-of-concepts. Through this piloting process we develop unique solutions in collaboration with our clients and community partners.</p><br>
